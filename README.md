# Welcome to the Geocoder in React Pedagogical App

See "vanilla-js-geocoded" for the vanilla html+javascript implementation of this app and compare it to the React version contained in this repository.

Note that I have not decluttered this repo and it contains several unneccessary files generated by the create-react-app framework. 

Finally, please see src/App.js for the code that makes this run, src/Index.js for the code that renders App.js to the html template and public/index.html for the template itself. 

I made a slight change to src/index.css to increase the margin size.
