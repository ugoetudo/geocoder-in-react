# Welcome to the Geocoder in React Pedagogical App

See "vanilla-js-geocoded" for the vanilla html+javascript implementation of this app and compare it to the React version contained in this repository.

Note that I have not decluttered this repo and it contains several unneccessary files generated by the create-react-app framework. 

Finally, please see src/App.js for the code that makes this run, src/Index.js for the code that renders App.js to the html template and public/index.html for the template itself. 

I made a slight change to src/index.css to increase the margin size.

## Cloning and Starting the App

To run the app, clone it locally, then open a chrome browser window with CORS disabled (we learned how to disable CORS in chrome by starting chrome with certain command line arguments). Next, navigate to the cloned directory in your terminal. From there, first install dependencies (npm install), then simply type npm start. If the application starts in a standard chrome window rather than your CORS disabled window, just copy the application URL and paste it in the CORS disabled Chrome instance (it should be localhost:3000).Â
